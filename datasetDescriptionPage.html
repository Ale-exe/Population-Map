        <img src="images/map.png">
        <p>The dataset used in the creation of the choropleth map was a dataset titled: England and Wales Census 2021 -
            TS007: Age by single year. This dataset contained 100 records for each region within England and Wales.
            Each record listed a numerical age from 0 to 100, along with an observation for each, effectively conveying
            the number of people recorded at each specific age. The data was gathered from the 2021 England and Wales
            census and thus was complete with no records missing, however was initially provided in a format inadequate
            for analysis. Consequently, the file was converted to JSON for more efficient processing of data.

        <p>The second chart utilises multiple datasets to compare population totals between 2011 and 2021 for different
            age groups. The dataset for the 2021 data was gathered from the 2021 England and Wales Census 2021, whereas
            the 2011 data was gathered from the previous 2011 census. Because two datasets were being used 10 years
            apart, there were likely going to be the inconsistencies between the two. Thankfully both datasets were
            published by the Office for National Statistics and therefore the format and regions of the datasets were
            identical, however, some of the region names were different. Because there were a significant number of
            records for each dataset, re-naming the records to ensure conformity was a lengthy process however once this
            was performed, the data was compatible and uniform.

        <img src="images/horizontal_bar.png">
        <p>The dataset used in the creation of the horizontal bar chart was a dataset titled: England and Wales Census
            2021 - RM163: Gender identity by age by sex. This dataset contains data for 7 age categories seen on the
            chart, along with observation counts for populations of male and female respondents for each region.
            Like the first dataset, data was gathered during the 2021 England and Wales census and thus was complete
            with no records missing, however a notable difference was that despite being from the same source as the
            previous chart, the age categories predefined into 7 categories were different to the previous chart.
            Initial worries were that these categories forming the Y axis would cause confusion, however following
            implementation, the data was deemed different enough to the vertical bar chart not to matter.

        <img src="images/line_chart.png">
        <p>The final dataset used in the creation of the visualisation was to generate the line graph of population
            over time from 2011 to 2023. Unlike the other charts, the data source was not census data, however was
            still recorded and published by the Office for National Statistics. The dataset was not immediately fit for
            purpose, as the data was split into region, gender, and counted each individual age from 0-100 seen in earlier
            discussed datasets. Due to aims of showing an overall population count per region and per gender, age was
            manipulated out of the data by summing the observation counts into one record for male and one record for
            female for each region before formulating the line chart. Unfortunately, this dataset featured 60,000 records
            and upon transposition into JSON format, over 100,000, meaning that time efficient data manipulation was
            imperative to achieving a usable visualisation that didn't take too long to calculate.
